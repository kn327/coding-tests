# Analog Clock Angles

Challenge:
Take a standard 12 hour clock. At any given time, the hour and minute hand form an angle representing the time. For example, 3:15 is 7.5 degrees, 12:30 is 180 degrees. Write a function that will compute the smallest angle between the hour and minute hands for a given time. Function should support switching between a 12 hour and 24 hour clock.
